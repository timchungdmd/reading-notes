# HTML Basics
- html: programming language to structure a website and its contents
- Elements: enclose contents
- Paragraph element: opening tag-content-closing tag
- Attributes: give element extra infromation that will not show up in the content
- Nesting element: element inside an element
- Empty elements do not have a closing tag
- Anatomy of HTML document(example)
   - <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en-US">
          <head>
            <meta charset="utf-8">
            <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
            <title>My test page</title>
          </head>
          <body>
            <img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">
          </body>
       </html>
- Image tag: <img src="url", alt="alt text"
                  
# Marking up Text
- H1 through 6 : Headings and subheading, equivalent of title and chapter titles, and subtitles
- Lists: \< ul > = unorderd list, \< ol >=ordered list, each list will have \<li>
- Links: \<a href='url'> text \</a>

# Semantics
- Semantics: meaning of a piece of code
  - HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling
- Benefits of Semantic markup: SEO, help visually impaired users, ease of search through blocks of meaningful codes, communication amongst developers what data will be populated in each block
- Exmaples of semantic elements can be found [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#inline_text_semantics),
