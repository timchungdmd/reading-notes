# HTML Basics
- html: programming language to structure a website and its contents
- Elements: enclose contents
- Paragraph element: opening tag-content-closing tag
- Attributes: give element extra infromation that will not show up in the content
- Nesting element: element inside an element
- Empty elements do not have a closing tag
- Anatomy of HTML document(example)
   - \<!DOCTYPE html><br> 
        \<html lang="en-US"><br> 
          \<head><br> 
            \<meta charset="utf-8"><br>  
            \<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"><br> 
            \<title>My test page</title><br> 
          \</head><br> 
          \<body><br> 
            \<img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"><br> 
          \</body><br> 
       \</html><br> 
- Image tag: \<img src="url", alt="alt text">
                  
# Marking up Text
- H1 through 6 : Headings and subheading, equivalent of title and chapter titles, and subtitles
- Lists: \< ul > = unorderd list, \< ol >=ordered list, each list will have \<li>
- Links: \<a href='url'> text \</a>

# Semantics
- Semantics: meaning of a piece of code
  - HTML should be coded to represent the data that will be populated and not based on its default presentation styling
- Benefits of Semantic markup: SEO, help visually impaired users, ease of search through blocks of meaningful codes, communication amongst developers what data will be populated in each block
- Exmaples of semantic elements can be found [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). [Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#inline_text_semantics),
