### Creating Hyperlinks

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside what element?
- Hyperlink is written inside an <a> element and href attribute

The href attribute contains what information?
- href contains the url address

What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?
- Write the hyperlink in regular text to make the information crystal clear.

### CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

What is meant by normal flow?
- "The way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven't changed their layout"

What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?
- "a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. The size of Inline elements is just the size of their content."
- "block-level elements begin on new lines, but inline elements can start anywhere in a line."

___ positioning is the default for every html element.
- Static

Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.
- Abolute position element sits on its own layer, in which we can create UI element that won't interact with rest of the page

What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?
- "absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (the initial containing block if there isn't one), fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport. (An exception to this occurs if one of the element's ancestors is a fixed containing block because its transform property has a value other than none.) "

### Functions â€“ Reusable Blocks of Code

Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.
- Functiona declaration means creating a function, and function invocation means the said function is being executed/ran by invoking it.

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
- Both terms can be used interchangeably. They are both values that need to be included in the function parantheses when said function is invoked.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
- 
Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.
- Engaged collaboration and learning from fellow students are two major benefits I see from pair programming. Software engineering is not a solo sports. It's a team sports, that is why github exists. I may catch an error or make an improvement that others might have missed, and vice versa. Through the engaged collobrative effort we can learn from each other, because there is always more than one way to solve a problem. Some might think of a more efficient coding to solve a problem, some might think of a more secure coding to solve a problem and etc. It's difficult for one person to come up with the infinite possibilities, because we all come from different backgrounds which influence the way we see and interact with this world. Also this collaborative environment will keep us connected to other humans regardless of where we work.
